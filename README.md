#  GPS Waypoint Tracker

Overview
- This Java application, developed as part of a programming assignment, allows users to track their movement by entering GPS waypoints. The program calculates the total 
  distance traveled and the average speed based on these waypoints.

Features
- Allows users to input an unlimited number of waypoints.
- Computes total distance traveled using a scaling factor to convert to miles.
- Calculates the average speed in miles per hour.
- Utilizes an inner class waypoint to store and process coordinate and timestamp data.
- User-friendly input for waypoints through the command line.
  
Prerequisites
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A command-line interface (CLI) or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can run Java applications.
  
How to Run
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open your command line interface or IDE.
- Navigate to the directory containing the GPS.java file.
- Compile the Java program with javac GPS.java.
- Run the compiled program using java GPS.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to enter waypoints.

Example Usage
Enter X co-ordinate(negative to end): 1
Enter Y co-ordinate: 2
Enter Time Stamp (seconds): 100
...
Enter X co-ordinate(negative to end): -1
